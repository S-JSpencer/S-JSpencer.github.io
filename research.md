## Inflationary Stimulated Raman Scattering
My primary research interest is in laser-plasma instabilities (LPI) relevant to the shock-ignition model of inertial confinement fusion (ICF). My current focus is on so-called "kinetic inflation" of Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) in the types of inhomogeneous plasmas we would expect to see on the National Ignition Facility.

## Astrophysical Pair-Plasma Jets
In collaboration with [Professor Mark Dieckmann](http://weber.itn.liu.se/~mardi06/), I am investigating the current-filamentation instability in astrophysical plasmas relevant to microquasar systems.
